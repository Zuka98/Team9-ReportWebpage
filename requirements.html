                        <p>With the increasing demand for mental health services it is important to understand the state of mind of the country to better provide services and help. Unfortunately, the diagnostic and recovery process is not as clear cut as reducing swelling or the recovery of a fractured bone. Observing the way people recover and function mentally requires close monitoring over an extended period of time. <br/ ><br />

                        That's where WellWellWell comes in. With the increasingly digital lifestyle, it is easiest to track a patient's recovery through their mobile phone. Through 4 of 5 of the Ways of Wellbeing, the app records patient data such as number of footsteps, usage of the Google search bar, and more to produce a "Wellbeing Score". This score is used to compare the relative wellbeing of a person to their peers, allows for their GP to monitor their willingness to recover (the subtle aspects of a person's behaviour that affect their state of mind, outlook of life, etc.) to better understand their patients on an individual and relative (to the population) scale.

This also allows GPs to better understand why their particular patients are recovering faster or slower and can give them valuable insight into their lives that they would otherwise have little or no insight into to better answer questions and give suggestions.</p>

Additionally, it can be used to predict the 'higher risk' areas where GPs should be more aware of the risk of poor mental health. This allows GPs and other health professionals to make better informed decisions, particularly when they involve a patient's mental wellbeing.</p>

He sees it as a blessing in disguise as he has time to pause and reflect on his life and focus on other life goals he had, but had set aside for rugby. He remains active and tries to go about his day as much as he can. His social life improves as a result of the increased free time he has.</p>
