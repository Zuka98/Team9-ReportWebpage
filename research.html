                <p>This project is relevant and paramount. Which is why we were surprised to realise there were limited, if any, such existing projects or technologies. There are an abundance of mental health related apps, however, from which inspiration can be drawn over how data is collected and used in their methods.</p>

              <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                <p>The biggest problem we encountered was moving the app from Android to iOS. This was primarly due to two reasons. Firstly, the original design being coded without consideration of cross platform development, which meant a complete rewrite of code would have been necessary to redevelop the application (in a very limited timeframe). Secondly, iOS has limited number of services that are allowed to run in the background. This made tracking data in realtime difficult, which is a vital element of the app. While this difficulty can probably be overcome by an experienced iOS developer, it has become a difficulty we are not able to overcome with the timeframe, and as such have decided to abandon the idea of an iOS app in this development cycle.</p>

                    <h3>Is my data secure?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Yes! All wellbeing score predictions are done in app and are only shared with your explicit permission to either your chosen carer or anonymously to an NHS nationwide database.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Can GP's access my data without my permission?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>No, your GP can only get your score predictions if you choose to share your score with them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Why do GP's want to know about my wellbeing?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>For a GP to properly understand someone's condition, they need to consider how their day to day activities may affect them. It would be time consuming and possibly unreliable to depend solely on a line of questioning to get the full picture, so this application would help to cut consultation time and give a standardised and easy to understand breakdown of patient wellbeing.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What is anonymous data sharing and how is it done?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Your wellbeing scores can be shared to a nationwide database based on your postcode area (the first part of your postcode). This is done without sending any uniquely identifiable information (e.g. names, date of birth). Additionally, a portion of the data in the database is randomised to ensure you cannot be uniquely identified or associated with a score in your postcode area.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Is this score actually relevant?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>This score will help you to better understand how your own lifestyle and activities affect you and how you may be able to positively change for your own mental and personal wellbeing. On a larger scale, this score allows the NHS to properly understand population health and allocate resources to higher risk or need areas.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                <div class="space-20 hidden visible-xs"></div>
                <div class="toggole-boxs">
                    <h3>Is my information shared with 3rd parties?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>No. Your data is either shared with your GP or other nominated carer or anonymously with the NHS. We will never share your data with any 3rd parties.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>If I delete the application, will the collected data be erased?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Any existing data you have shared either to your GP or the nationwide database will remain there, but any locally stored data will be erased if you uninstall the application.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What if I don't agree with the prediction scores?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>You can dispute the scores predicted by providing feedback on your scores when choosing to share your data. This will help us to improve our prediction model and help us to provide more accurate insight and information to provide better care for you and other users in the future.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>How is my mental and physical health related?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Mental and physical health are closely linked in many ways. For instance, your diet and activeness may affect your mood and general health. If your mental health is poor, you may lose interest in your hobbies or lose your appetite, which can affect your physical wellbeing.

                    <h3>What are the 5 Ways to Wellbeing?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>The 5 Ways to Wellbeing is an NHS approved framework for gauging a person's mental wellbeing. The 5 ways are</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Connect - How actively engaged you are in communication with people</li>
                          <li>Be Active - How physically active you are, walking, cycling, etc.</li>
                          <li>Keep Learning - How interested you are in learning new skills and things</li>
                          <li>Give to Others - How charitable you are, relating to a sense of community</li>
                          <li>Be Mindful - How aware you are of your surroundings, including your thoughts and feelings</li>
