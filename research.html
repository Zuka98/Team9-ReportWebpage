                <p>This project is relevant and paramount. Which is why we were surprised to realise there were limited, if any, such existing projects or technologies. There are an abundance of mental health related apps, however, from which inspiration can be drawn over how data is collected and used in their methods.</p>

               <h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
              <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                <p>The biggest problem we encountered was moving the app from Android to iOS. This was primarly due to two reasons. Firstly, the original design being coded without consideration of cross platform development, which meant a complete rewrite of code would have been necessary to redevelop the application (in a very limited timeframe). Secondly, iOS has limited number of services that are allowed to run in the background. This made tracking data in realtime difficult, which is a vital element of the app. While this difficulty can probably be overcome by an experienced iOS developer, it has become a difficulty we are not able to overcome with the timeframe, and as such have decided to abandon the idea of an iOS app in this development cycle.</p>

                    <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence focusing on the analysis and processing of human or natural languages. This includes detecting usage of particular words, phrases and sentence structures to name a few. Sentiment analysis was the most relevant and appropriate method to use for our purposes, which breaks down sentences into sentiments and classifies their type based on their location in a sentence. This was to be used for analysing a diary feature as part of the application to determine a person’s mental well-being based on their writing style. It was, however, abandoned and as such this research was not used.</p>

                    <h3>Data Randomisation for Anonymity</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Due to GDPR regulations, we could not allow any one particular person to be uniquely identifiable with information that is meant to be anonymous. As such, our method of randomisation allowed for anonymity while maintaining strong data integrity. 70% of all data is accurate, whereas 30% has been randomised to ensure that no one particular data subject can be identified and attributed to the queried score, even if they are the only individual in the identified postcode.</p>

                    <h3>5 Ways to Wellbeing</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>The 5 Ways to Wellbeing is an NHS approved framework for gauging a person's mental wellbeing. The 5 ways are</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Connect - How actively engaged you are in communication with people</li>
                          <li>Be Active - How physically active you are, walking, cycling, etc.</li>
                          <li>Keep Learning - How interested you are in learning new skills and things</li>
                          <li>Give to Others - How charitable you are, relating to a sense of community</li>
                          <li>Be Mindful - How aware you are of your surroundings, including your thoughts and feelings</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Bayes' Theorem</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Bayes' theorem is a statistical theorem that describes probabilities given that a previous event has occured. Bayes' theorem is described using conditional probability and uses the probabilities of previous events that have occured to predict the probability of another event occuring. This is particularly useful in predicting a wellbeing score given that the user can report an error in prediction, either positive or negative. Using the theorem, it can take in user feedback and determine the likely accurate score for the user and population.</p>

                        <p>We have developed a visualisation system that allows the visualisation of any set of data stored on the cloud based on postcode area in the United Kingdom. While it was designed for use in the UK, the way we designed the framework should allow it to be repurposed for use in any country and region.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Background processes in Android and iOS</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>In our research, we found that iOS does not allow applications to run background processes for a sufficient amount of time for the WellWellWell application to be practically deployed on the operating system and as such, have decided to only develop the application on Android. Additionally, iOS does not allow applications to query application usage, which is necessary for tracking the number of minutes on call, texts, etc. The Android application uses the pedometer and queries application usage for data collection.</p>
